Learned about divide and conqure and little bit about merge sort. No coding part is in this lecture.

Divide and Conquer Algorithm:-> is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems by dividing the main problem into subproblems, solving them individually and then merging them to find solution to the original problem. 
In this article, we are going to discuss how Divide and Conquer Algorithm is helpful and how we can use it to solve problems.

Merge sort:-> is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. 
It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
